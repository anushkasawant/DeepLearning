What is Name gender identification?


Name gender identification is the process of using computers to predict whether a given name belongs to a male or female person. This is done using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze patterns in names and their associated genders.

Develop a model that can accurately predict the gender (male or female) associated with a given name. The model should take a name as input and provide a label indicating the likelihood of the name belonging to each gender category.

Import Libraries
We first must import the necessary libraries to work with any data and build a solution. Our project will use Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, nltk and Keras.
