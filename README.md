What is Name gender identification?


Name gender identification is the process of using computers to predict whether a given name belongs to a male or female person. This is done using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze patterns in names and their associated genders.

Develop a model that can accurately predict the gender (male or female) associated with a given name. The model should take a name as input and provide a label indicating the likelihood of the name belonging to each gender category.

Data augmentation in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a technique used to artificially increase the size and diversity of a training dataset by creating variations of the original text data
In our dataset ,since the Name column contained only 1299 observations , we opted for data augmentation.
